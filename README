CapistranoMonit: A Capistrano Plugin
====================================

CapistranoMonit is a Capistrano Plugin that adds functionality to setup/configure the control file for monit and adds "restart" functionality to apply those changes.


Setup
=====

CapistranoMonit requires the following variables:

set :domain, "yourserver.com"
set :mongrel_port, "8000"

CapistranoMonit also allows you to customize the following variables:

set :monit_daemon_interval, "120"
set :monit_alert_email, "you@example.com"

Simply define them in your capistrano config/deploy.rb.


Example
=======

After installation and adding the appropriate monit variables:

$ cap monit:setup
$ cap monit:restart

You can even make sure the monit setup gets run after your setup tasks, in your deploy.rb file:

after "servers:setup", "monit:setup"
